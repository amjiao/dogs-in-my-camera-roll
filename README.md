# dogs in my camera roll - an app

## About
The concept is an Android UI for a social media app dedicated to sharing photos of dogs. Photos are shared in "collections" consisting of "posts" which include the image and a caption. The UI also supports commenting on posts and generating random dog pictures from The DogCEO API. 

This app was built with Kotlin (Jetpack Compose). I hope to add posting functionality and more modular user profiles in the future.
